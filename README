DocBook to .docx
================

Le-tex transpect is an "open source framework for converting and checking documents".

The framework is solved many technical issues already, so I overcame the "not invented here syndrome" and decided to rely on this tool.

DocBook to .docx conversion is far from complete. For my documents, I need to extend the stylesheet and fix bugs. To do it, I made a clone of the le-tex repository.

If you want to try the code, start with "doc/hello-world".
